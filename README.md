This project provides a tool for procedural dungeon generation using three approaches:

## CorridorFirst

Creating random corridors, followed by adding rooms.

## RoomFirst

Generating rooms through binary space partitioning, then connecting them with corridors.

## Hive

Utilizing physics simulation for room placement and connection.

## Customization

Each generation method supports fine-tuned customization for crafting unique dungeons.
